# blip-loader

A node module that adds a loading animation. The loader animation is rendered in a canvas element inside a container of your choice. It is enough to require the module and the module takes care of the rest. Here is a [live demo](http://githug.github.io/blip-loader).

### Installation
`npm install blip-loader --save`

### Usage
- Require blip-clock in your project.
- Add a container html element (such as a div, or anything really) and give it the id blipLoader
```
<div id="blipLoader"></div>
```
- That's it! Now you should have a loading animation that can spice up the otherwise boring loading times.
